# matching_grb_frb_script
This script can be used to find overlapping events between 2 catalogs. It compares the location (RA/DEC) and time of event to find any similarities.
The script can be adapted by changing the lines with comments.


Usage requirements:
- The script requires .csv files and knowledge of what column contains the GRB/FRB code, the event time, RA, DEC, and RA/DEC errors.
- Input a time uncertainty when prompted
- The package 'pandas' is required which can be installed here: https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html
